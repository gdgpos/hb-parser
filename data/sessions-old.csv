120,16,14:45,15:15,Beginner,"Just about when the COVID situation was evolving into a pandemic, a journalist contacted me lamenting the fact they as journalists, would have to go to Johns Hopkins site and manually sum up the Caribbean relevant data. Armed with the link to the open Johns Hopkins data, it quickly became clear that what they needed could easily be built. Several months later, the code and features have evolved. In this lightning talk I would walk through my tech stack (React.js), parsing the CSV from Johns Hopkins and deployment. If time permits, I can talk a bit about deciding to make this map open source.",janiqua,"javascript, COVID","caricovidmap, making caribbean focused information more accesible."

230,17,12:25,12:55,Intermediate,"For several years now, that we’ve been trying to find new solutions on how we could develop a single project and run it on all platforms. We’ve been seeing all types of solutions: some are web-based, others require you to learn a new language, and others even may require that you pay a monthly fee to use. It also comes with the drawback that all your UI depends on the framework implementation. So, if there’s a native update you’ll need to wait until someone rewrites the widgets for you to update your app.

Kotlin multiplatform gives us a new solution. It focuses on sharing your business logic across all platforms, leaving the UI to be implemented natively. Since it’s Kotlin, you can take full advantage of its language features - concise, safe, etc. Moreover, if you’re coming from android you might already be familiarised with Kotlin and even if you’re an iOS developer you’ll see that it’s quite similar to Swift.

260,17,13:40,14:05,Intermediate,"Chances are if you've ever had to parse some data from an endpoint you were using a RESTFUL API, as it's been around for many years and is widely used. GraphQL was created by Facebook and made available for public use in 2015. It gives you the power of requesting the exact data you need from a server in a single query and receive it in a JSON object; whereas in REST you have to make requests to multiple endpoints in gathering data. This take we will jump straight into GraphQl and how to use it in Flutter",deandrew_moore,"flutter', 'dart', 'graphql', 'mobile-technologies'",Introduction to GraphQL in Flutter

290,17,15:05,03:35,Intermediate,"Traditional methods of interacting, such as keyboards, mouse and multi-touch screens are now being accompanied, and to some degree, replaced by natural language-based interactions in the form of “conversational experiences”. This relatively new form of interaction is driven by Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI). Conversational AI is already impacting industries by creating “human-like” exchanges between end-users and software systems and presents a promising role in evolving how humans interact with computer systems in the future. However, given this uptrend of adopting Conversational AI, the world of Management Information Systems remains untouched by this phenomenon. In this talk, we will be looking at way to integrate and build MIS based tasks into a virtual assistant using DialogFlow to figure out the question...can the interaction between humans and Management Information Systems be changing?",deenauth,"chatbots', 'conversational_ai', 'conversational_artificial_intelligence', 'dialogflow', 'asr'",Conversational AI and Management Information Systems.

How do you build a product that makes users' lives easier and/or better? How do you uncover users' needs? How do you incorporate users and their needs into your design process? How do you make sure users are central to your design process? How do you involve the entire team (engineers, too!) in this user-centered design process?

This is a talk about my experience completing Phase 1 of a major solution project with volunteers, local mental health service providers, and Regional health industry leaders to build a mental health platform to improve accessibility to mental health in our country in response to COVID-19 and other disasters.

510,18,13:00,13:00,Intermediate,"In this session, my major aim would be to provide an overview of the different tools one could use to power their Android apps with Machine Learning and also discuss the new additions for Machine Learning in Android 11 specifically the Model Binding Plugin and ML Kit. I would first go on to explain the standard procedure of using pre-trained models with MLKit. I would show how we could take the idea of MLKit forward and use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub to run right in the app, which would provide support to build high-quality machine learning apps based on models contributed from the community. I would then show how we could use custom TFLite models in Android apps, I would also talk about TensorFlow Model Maker and ML Model binding plugin in Android Studio through which I plan to show how easy it is to now use custom TF Lite models in Android apps. With Android 11 the NN API now supports Asymmetric integer weights making model sizes and inferences even smaller opening up an even larger opportunities for edge ML.
If time persists, I would also show demos about the above topics.  ",rishit_dagli,"android11', 'ml', 'tensorflow'",Superpower your Android apps with ML: Android 11
